# ShortURL

This is a basic Spring-Boot and React JS app.

The list of urls are hardcoded in the backend and the same is fetched from the REST CALL.

Use the command prompt to run the Spring boot application with the command : mvn spring-boot:run in the directory of spring

The front end fetches the data from the rest call and renders it for the user.
Use yarn start to start the application.
