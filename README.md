# ShortURL

This is a  Spring-Boot and React JS app that takes a valid url in the form of "http://website" and creates a shortened version of the same.

The list of urls are added to the database in the backend and the same is fetched from the REST CALL and rendered in the form of tables.

Use the command prompt to run the Spring boot application with the command : mvn spring-boot:run in the directory "ShortenURLtask\Shorturltaskleverton"

To start the React Application, run yarn start in the directory "ShortenURLtask\ReactAPP"
